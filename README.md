 Learn Flutter and Beyond

 I will publish my personal projects here that I am building while learning Flutter.<br>
 Some of these projects are inspired from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller`s Udemy course "Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2023 Edition]".

 To see any of the application:
 <ul>
  <li>Create new Flutter preoject using 'flutter create <app_name>'.</li>
   <li>Replace Lib folder with published folder.</li>
   <li>If there are assets files and additional dependencies are required, then insert assets in your project and update the pubspec.yml file accordingly.</li>
   <li>execute 'flutter run'.</li>
 </ul>
